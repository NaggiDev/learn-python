# Design Document: Python Learning Path

## Overview

This design document outlines the architecture and implementation details for a comprehensive Python learning path that follows the "experience -> repeat -> learning" methodology. The learning path is structured into three main levels (Basic, Intermediate, and Advanced) with a focus on practical, hands-on learning through real-world projects. The system is designed to provide a progressive learning experience that builds upon previous knowledge while reinforcing concepts through strategic repetition.

## Architecture

The Python Learning Path will be organized as a hierarchical structure of modules, lessons, exercises, and projects. The architecture follows these principles:

1. **Modularity**: Content is organized into self-contained modules that can be completed independently while building upon previous modules.

2. **Progressive Complexity**: Each level increases in complexity, with concepts building upon previously learned material.

3. **Practical Application**: Every theoretical concept is paired with practical exercises and real-world projects.

4. **Reinforcement Through Repetition**: Key concepts appear multiple times in different contexts to reinforce learning.

5. **Adaptable Learning Paths**: While there is a recommended progression, the architecture allows for some flexibility in the order of completion.

## Components and Interfaces

### 1. Module Structure

Each module will follow a consistent structure:

```
module_name/
├── README.md           # Module overview, learning objectives, prerequisites
├── lessons/            # Theoretical content and explanations
│   ├── lesson1.md
│   ├── lesson2.md
│   └── ...
├── exercises/          # Hands-on practice exercises
│   ├── exercise1.py
│   ├── exercise2.py
│   └── ...
├── solutions/          # Reference solutions for exercises
│   ├── solution1.py
│   ├── solution2.py
│   └── ...
└── mini_project/       # Module culmination project
    ├── README.md       # Project requirements and instructions
    ├── starter_code/   # Scaffolding code if needed
    └── solution/       # Reference implementation
```

### 2. Level Structure

Each level (Basic, Intermediate, Advanced) will be organized as follows:

```
level_name/
├── README.md           # Level overview, learning path, prerequisites
├── module1/           
├── module2/

    ├── README.md       # Project requirements and instructions
    ├── starter_code/   # Scaffolding code if needed
    └── solution/       # Reference implementation
```

### 3. Exercise Interface

Exercises will follow a consistent format:

- Clear instructions at the top of the file
- TODO comments indicating where code should be written
- Test cases to verify the solution
- Expected output or behavior description

Example:
```python
"""
Exercise: Function to calculate the factorial of a number

Instructions:
1. Implement the factorial function below
2. The function should return the factorial of the input number
3. Handle edge cases (negative numbers, zero)
4. Run the tests to verify your solution
"""

def factorial(n):
    # TODO: Implement the factorial function
    pass

# Tests
def test_factorial():
    assert factorial(0) == 1
    assert factorial(1) == 1
    assert factorial(5) == 120
    try:
        factorial(-1)
        print("Test failed: Should raise ValueError for negative numbers")
    except ValueError:
        print("Test passed: Correctly raised ValueError for negative numbers")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_factorial()
    print("All tests completed")
```
