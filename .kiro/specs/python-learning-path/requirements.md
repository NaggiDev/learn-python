# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a comprehensive Python learning path designed to help users master Python through a practical "experience -> repeat -> learning" approach. The learning path is structured into multiple levels (basic, intermediate, advanced) with each level building upon the previous one. The focus is on providing hands-on experience through real-world projects, reinforcing concepts through repetition, and facilitating deep learning through practical application.
