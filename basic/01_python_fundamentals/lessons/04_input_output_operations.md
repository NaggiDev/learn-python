## Introduction to Input/Output

Input/Output (I/O) operations are fundamental to creating interactive programs. They allow your program to:
- Receive data from users (input)
- Display information to users (output)
- Interact with files and other external resources

In this lesson, we'll focus on console I/O, which involves getting input from the keyboard and displaying output to the screen.

## Getting User Input

### The input() Function

Python provides the `input()` function to get input from the user. When this function is called, the program pauses and waits for the user to type something and press Enter.

```python
# Basic input example
name = input("What is your name? ")
print("Hello, " + name + "!")
```

When you run this code:
1. The message "What is your name? " is displayed
2. The program waits for the user to type something and press Enter
3. Whatever the user typed is stored in the variable `name`
4. The program continues and greets the user

### Converting Input to Different Types

The `input()` function always returns a string, regardless of what the user types. If you need a different data type, you need to convert it explicitly:

```python
# Converting input to an integer
age_str = input("How old are you? ")
age = int(age_str)
print("Next year, you will be", age + 1, "years old.")

# More concise version
age = int(input("How old are you? "))
print("Next year, you will be", age + 1, "years old.")
```

Common conversion functions:
- `int()`: Converts to integer
- `float()`: Converts to floating-point number
- `bool()`: Converts to boolean
- `str()`: Converts to string (rarely needed with input)

Error handling is important when converting types:

```python
try:
    age = int(input("How old are you? "))
    print("Next year, you will be", age + 1, "years old.")
except ValueError:
    print("That's not a valid age!")
```

## Displaying Output

### The print() Function

The `print()` function is used to display output to the console:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

You can print variables of any type:

```python
name = "Alice"
age = 30
height = 5.8
is_student = False

print(name)       # Alice
print(age)        # 30
print(height)     # 5.8
print(is_student) # False
```

### Multiple Arguments

You can pass multiple arguments to `print()`, separated by commas:

```python
name = "Alice"
age = 30
print("Name:", name, "Age:", age)  # Name: Alice Age: 30
```

By default, `print()` adds a space between each argument.

### End and Sep Parameters

The `print()` function has two useful parameters for controlling output:

- `sep`: Specifies the separator between arguments (default is a space)
- `end`: Specifies what to print at the end (default is a newline `\n`)

```python
# Changing the separator
print("apple", "banana", "cherry", sep=", ")  # apple, banana, cherry

# Changing the end character
print("Hello", end=" ")
print("World")  # Hello World (on the same line)

# Using both parameters
print("apple", "banana", "cherry", sep=" | ", end=".\n")  # apple | banana | cherry.
```

## String Formatting

Python offers several ways to format strings for output. Each has its advantages and use cases.

### Using the % Operator (Old Style)

This is the oldest method, similar to C's `printf()`:

```python
name = "Alice"
age = 30
print("My name is %s and I am %d years old." % (name, age))
```

Common format specifiers:
- `%s`: String
- `%d`: Integer
- `%f`: Float
- `%.2f`: Float with 2 decimal places

### Using the format() Method

The `format()` method provides more flexibility:

```python
name = "Alice"
age = 30
print("My name is {} and I am {} years old.".format(name, age))

# With positional arguments
print("My name is {0} and I am {1} years old.".format(name, age))

# With named arguments
print("My name is {n} and I am {a} years old.".format(n=name, a=age))
```

### Using f-Strings (Python 3.6+)

f-Strings (formatted string literals) are the newest and most concise way to format strings:

```python
name = "Alice"
age = 30
print(f"My name is {name} and I am {age} years old.")
```

You can include expressions inside the curly braces:

```python
age = 30
print(f"In five years, I will be {age + 5} years old.")

# You can call functions too
print(f"Lowercase name: {name.lower()}")
```

### Formatting Specifiers

All three formatting methods support specifiers for controlling how values are displayed:

```python
pi = 3.14159265359

# Controlling decimal places
print(f"Pi to 2 decimal places: {pi:.2f}")  # 3.14
print("Pi to 4 decimal places: {:.4f}".format(pi))  # 3.1416

# Width and alignment
print(f"|{name:10}|")  # |Alice     |  (right-aligned in 10-character field)
print(f"|{name:<10}|")  # |Alice     |  (left-aligned)
print(f"|{name:^10}|")  # |  Alice   |  (centered)

# Numbers with padding
print(f"ID: {42:04d}")  # ID: 0042

# Percentage
print(f"Score: {0.75:.1%}")  # Score: 75.0%
```

## Working with Files (Preview)

While we'll cover file operations in detail in a later module, here's a brief preview:

```python
# Writing to a file
with open("example.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write("Hello, World!\n")
    file.write("This is a test file.")

# Reading from a file
with open("example.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)
```

The `with` statement ensures the file is properly closed after the block is executed.

## Best Practices

1. **Always provide clear prompts for input**:
   ```python
   # Good
   name = input("Please enter your name: ")
   
   # Not as good
   name = input("Name: ")
   
   # Bad
   name = input()  # No prompt at all
   ```

2. **Validate user input**:
   ```python
   while True:
       try:
           age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
           if age < 0 or age > 120:
               print("Please enter a realistic age between 0 and 120.")
               continue
           break
       except ValueError:
           print("Please enter a valid number.")
   ```

3. **Use f-strings for readability** (when using Python 3.6+):
   ```python
   # More readable
   print(f"Hello, {name}! You are {age} years old.")
   
   # Less readable
   print("Hello, " + name + "! You are " + str(age) + " years old.")
   ```

4. **Choose the appropriate string formatting method** based on your needs and Python version.

5. **Use meaningful variable names** for input and output operations.

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Forgetting that input() returns a string**:
   ```python
   # This will cause an error
   age = input("Enter your age: ")
   next_year_age = age + 1  # TypeError: can't add int to str
   
   # Correct way
   age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
   next_year_age = age + 1
   ```

2. **Not handling invalid input**:
   ```python
   # This will crash if the user enters a non-numeric value
   age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
   
   # Better approach
   try:
       age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
   except ValueError:
       print("That's not a valid age!")
   ```

3. **Mixing string formatting styles**, which can make code harder to read and maintain:
   ```python
   # Inconsistent and confusing
   name = "Alice"
   age = 30
   print("Name: %s" % name)
   print("Age: {}".format(age))
   ```

4. **Overcomplicating simple output**:
   ```python
   # Unnecessarily complex
   print("Result: " + str(format(3.14159, '.2f')))
   
   # Simpler and clearer
   print(f"Result: {3.14159:.2f}")
   ```

## Practice Exercises

To reinforce your understanding, try the following exercises:

1. Create a simple calculator that takes two numbers as input and performs basic operations
2. Write a program that asks for a user's name and age, then tells them what year they'll turn 100
3. Experiment with different string formatting techniques to display tabular data
4. Create a "Mad Libs" game that asks for different words and inserts them into a story
