# Command-Line Calculator Mini-Project

## Project Overview

In this mini-project, you will build a command-line calculator application that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations. This project will help you apply the Python fundamentals you've learned throughout this module, including variables, operators, input/output operations, control flow, and functions.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will:

1. Apply Python fundamentals in a practical, real-world application
2. Practice handling user input and providing appropriate output
3. Implement error handling for invalid inputs
4. Design modular code using functions
5. Gain experience with program flow control

## Requirements

Your command-line calculator must:

1. **Support basic arithmetic operations:**
   - Addition (+)
   - Subtraction (-)
   - Multiplication (*)
   - Division (/)
   - Exponentiation (**)
   - Modulus (%)

2. **Handle user interaction:**
   - Display a welcome message and instructions
   - Prompt for operations and numbers
   - Display results clearly
   - Allow for multiple calculations in one session
   - Provide a way to exit the program

3. **Implement error handling:**
   - Handle division by zero
   - Validate numeric input
   - Handle invalid operation selection
   - Provide helpful error messages

4. **Include the following features:**
   - A main menu with operation options
   - History of calculations in the current session
   - Option to clear calculation history
   - Memory function to store and recall a value

## Project Structure

Your project should include the following files:

1. `calculator.py` - The main program file
2. `test_calculator.py` - Tests for your calculator functions

## Implementation Guidelines

1. **Plan before coding:**
   - Sketch the user interface flow
   - Identify the functions you'll need
   - Consider edge cases and error scenarios

2. **Write modular code:**
   - Create separate functions for different operations
   - Keep your functions small and focused
   - Use meaningful variable and function names

3. **Test thoroughly:**
   - Test each operation with various inputs
   - Test edge cases (very large numbers, zero, negative numbers)
   - Test error handling

4. **Document your code:**
   - Add comments explaining complex logic
   - Include docstrings for functions
   - Add a brief explanation of how to use the program

## Getting Started

We've provided a starter code file (`calculator.py`) with some basic structure to help you get started. Your task is to complete the implementation according to the requirements above.

## Extension Challenges

If you complete the basic requirements and want to challenge yourself further, try implementing these additional features:

1. Add support for more advanced operations (square root, logarithms, trigonometric functions)
2. Implement a way to handle multi-step calculations following order of operations
3. Add the ability to save calculation history to a file
4. Create a more sophisticated interface with colored text or ASCII art
5. Implement unit conversion functionality (e.g., between metric and imperial units)

## Submission

Your submission should include:

1. Your completed `calculator.py` file
2. Any additional files you created
3. A brief reflection on what you learned and any challenges you faced

## Evaluation Criteria

Your project will be evaluated based on:

1. Functionality - Does it meet all the requirements?
2. Code quality - Is your code well-organized, readable, and commented?
3. Error handling - Does your program handle invalid inputs gracefully?
4. User experience - Is your calculator intuitive and easy to use?

Good luck, and have fun building your calculator!
