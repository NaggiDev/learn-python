# Command-Line Calculator - Starter Code

This directory contains the starter code for the Command-Line Calculator mini-project.

## Files

- `calculator_starter.py`: The starter code with function stubs and TODOs
- `test_calculator_starter.py`: Tests for the calculator functions

## Getting Started

1. Copy the starter code files to your working directory
2. Read through the code and understand the structure
3. Implement the functions marked with TODO comments
4. Test your implementation using the provided test file

## Implementation Steps

1. Start by implementing the basic arithmetic functions:
   - `add()`
   - `subtract()`
   - `multiply()`
   - `divide()`
   - `power()`
   - `modulus()`

2. Implement the `get_number_input()` function to handle user input

3. Complete the `main()` function to:
   - Handle user menu choices
   - Get input for calculations
   - Display results
   - Manage calculation history
   - Implement memory functions

4. Test your implementation with various inputs

## Testing

You can test your implementation using the provided test file:

```
python test_calculator_starter.py
```

Make sure all tests pass before considering your implementation complete.

## Requirements Checklist

- [ ] Basic arithmetic operations
- [ ] User interaction with menu
- [ ] Error handling
- [ ] Calculation history
- [ ] Memory functions
- [ ] Clean code with comments

Good luck with your implementation!
