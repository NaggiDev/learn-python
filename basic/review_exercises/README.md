# Basic to Intermediate Review Exercises

## Overview

These review exercises are designed to reinforce basic Python concepts while introducing intermediate-level thinking. Each exercise combines multiple basic concepts and provides a bridge to intermediate topics.

## Learning Objectives

By completing these exercises, you will:
- Reinforce fundamental Python concepts through practical application
- Practice combining multiple basic concepts in single solutions
- Prepare for intermediate-level programming challenges
- Develop problem-solving skills that bridge basic and intermediate topics

## Prerequisites

Before starting these exercises, you should have completed:
- Basic Level: Python Fundamentals
- Basic Level: Data Structures
- Basic Level: File Operations

## Exercise Structure

Each exercise includes:
- Clear problem statement and requirements
- Starter code with TODO comments
- Test cases for validation
- Reference solution
- Extension challenges for further practice

## Exercises

1. **Student Grade Manager** - Combines functions, data structures, and file operations
2. **Text Processing Pipeline** - Integrates string manipulation, file I/O, and data analysis
3. **Inventory Management System** - Merges dictionaries, lists, and basic algorithms
4. **Log File Analyzer** - Combines file operations, string processing, and data aggregation
5. **Contact Book Application** - Integrates multiple data structures and user interaction

## Getting Started

1. Read through each exercise's requirements carefully
2. Implement your solution in the provided starter code
3. Run the test cases to validate your implementation
4. Compare your solution with the reference implementation
5. Try the extension challenges for additional practice

## Tips for Success

- Break down complex problems into smaller, manageable functions
- Use appropriate data structures for each task
- Handle edge cases and errors gracefully
- Write clean, readable code with meaningful variable names
- Test your code thoroughly with different inputs
