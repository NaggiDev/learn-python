# Command-Line Task Manager

## Overview

This Command-Line Task Manager is a Python application that allows users to manage their tasks through a simple text-based interface. The application serves as the capstone project for the Basic level of the Python Learning Path, integrating concepts from Python fundamentals, data structures, and file operations.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will:

- Apply Python fundamentals in a real-world application
- Practice working with data structures (lists, dictionaries)
- Implement file I/O operations for data persistence
- Create a user-friendly command-line interface
- Handle user input and provide appropriate feedback
- Implement error handling for robust application behavior
- Write clean, well-documented code following best practices

## Getting Started

1. Review the `requirements.md` file to understand the project specifications
2. Examine the starter code in `task_manager.py`
3. Run the application to see the basic structure: `python task_manager.py`
4. Implement the required functionality according to the requirements
5. Test your implementation using the provided test file

## Requirements

See the detailed requirements in the `requirements.md` file.

## Implementation Guidelines

1. Start by implementing the basic data structures to represent tasks
2. Add functionality to create and display tasks
3. Implement task updating and deletion features
4. Add file I/O operations for data persistence
5. Enhance the user interface and error handling
6. Test your implementation thoroughly

## Testing

Run the tests using:

```
python task_manager_test.py
```

The tests will verify that your implementation meets the requirements.

## Extension Challenges

After completing the basic requirements, try implementing some of these extensions:

1. Add task prioritization (high, medium, low)
2. Implement categories or tags for tasks
3. Add search functionality
4. Implement due date reminders
5. Add sorting options for the task list
6. Enhance the UI with color-coded output
