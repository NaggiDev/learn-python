# Command-Line Task Manager Application Requirements

## Project Overview

The Command-Line Task Manager is a Python application that allows users to manage their tasks through a simple command-line interface. This project serves as the capstone for the Basic level of the Python Learning Path, integrating concepts from Python fundamentals, data structures, and file operations.

## Project Scope

The application will provide a simple but functional task management system with the following capabilities:
- Create, read, update, and delete tasks
- Mark tasks as complete or incomplete
- View tasks with different filters (all, complete, incomplete)
- Save tasks to a file for persistence between sessions
- Basic error handling and user feedback

## User Stories and Acceptance Criteria

### User Story 1: Task Creation
**As a** user,  
**I want to** add new tasks to my task list,  
**So that** I can keep track of things I need to do.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN the user selects the option to add a task THEN the system SHALL prompt for task details
2. WHEN the user enters a task title THEN the system SHALL create a new task with that title
3. WHEN the user enters a task description THEN the system SHALL associate it with the task
4. WHEN the user enters a due date THEN the system SHALL validate and store it with the task
5. WHEN a new task is created THEN the system SHALL assign it a unique identifier
6. WHEN a new task is created THEN the system SHALL set its status to "incomplete" by default

### User Story 2: Viewing Tasks
**As a** user,  
**I want to** view my list of tasks,  
**So that** I can see what I need to work on.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN the user selects the option to view tasks THEN the system SHALL display all tasks
2. WHEN displaying tasks THEN the system SHALL show the task ID, title, description, due date, and status
3. WHEN the user selects to filter by status THEN the system SHALL only show tasks with the selected status
4. WHEN no tasks exist THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate message
5. WHEN displaying tasks THEN the system SHALL format the output in a readable manner

### User Story 3: Updating Tasks
**As a** user,  
**I want to** update existing tasks,  
**So that** I can modify details or mark tasks as complete.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN the user selects the option to update a task THEN the system SHALL prompt for the task ID
2. WHEN the user enters a valid task ID THEN the system SHALL display the current task details
3. WHEN the user provides new information for a field THEN the system SHALL update that field
4. WHEN the user leaves a field blank THEN the system SHALL keep the existing value
5. WHEN the user selects to mark a task as complete THEN the system SHALL update its status
6. WHEN the task ID does not exist THEN the system SHALL display an error message

### User Story 4: Deleting Tasks
**As a** user,  
**I want to** delete tasks I no longer need,  
**So that** my task list stays relevant and manageable.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN the user selects the option to delete a task THEN the system SHALL prompt for the task ID
2. WHEN the user confirms deletion THEN the system SHALL remove the task from the list
3. WHEN the task ID does not exist THEN the system SHALL display an error message
4. WHEN a task is successfully deleted THEN the system SHALL confirm the deletion

### User Story 5: Data Persistence
**As a** user,  
**I want** my tasks to be saved between sessions,  
**So that** I don't lose my data when I close the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL load existing tasks from a file
2. WHEN the application exits THEN the system SHALL save all tasks to a file
3. WHEN the save file doesn't exist THEN the system SHALL create a new one
4. IF the save file is corrupted THEN the system SHALL handle the error gracefully
5. WHEN saving tasks THEN the system SHALL use a CSV format for compatibility

### User Story 6: User Interface
**As a** user,  
**I want** a clear and intuitive interface,  
**So that** I can use the application without confusion.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL display a welcome message and menu
2. WHEN displaying the menu THEN the system SHALL show all available options
3. WHEN the user makes an invalid selection THEN the system SHALL display an error message
4. WHEN the user selects to exit THEN the system SHALL confirm before closing
5. WHEN displaying information THEN the system SHALL use consistent formatting

## Technical Requirements

1. The application must be implemented in Python using only standard library modules
2. Tasks must be stored in a CSV file with appropriate field delimiters
3. The application must handle common errors gracefully (file not found, invalid input)
4. Code must follow PEP 8 style guidelines
5. Functions must include docstrings explaining their purpose and parameters
6. The application must include basic unit tests for core functionality

## Stretch Goals (Optional)

These features are not required but could be implemented as extensions:

1. Task prioritization (high, medium, low)
2. Task categories or tags
3. Search functionality
4. Due date reminders
5. Task sorting options
6. Color-coded output based on priority or status
