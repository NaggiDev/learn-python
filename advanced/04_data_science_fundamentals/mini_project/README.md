- Data visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn
- Interactive dashboard creation

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will:

1. **Apply the complete data science workflow** from data loading to insights presentation
2. **Integrate multiple Python libraries** (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SciPy)
3. **Perform comprehensive data analysis** including descriptive statistics, hypothesis testing, and correlation analysis
4. **Create professional visualizations** that effectively communicate insights
5. **Build an interactive dashboard** that allows exploration of different aspects of the data
6. **Practice data storytelling** by presenting findings in a clear, actionable format

## Project Scenario

You are a data analyst for "TechCorp Analytics," a consulting company that helps businesses understand their performance through data. A retail client has provided you with their sales data and wants a comprehensive analysis dashboard that will help them:

- Understand sales patterns and trends
- Identify top-performing products and regions
- Analyze customer behavior and seasonality
- Make data-driven decisions for inventory and marketing

## Dataset Description

The project uses a synthetic retail sales dataset with the following features:

- **Date**: Transaction date
- **Product_Category**: Category of product sold (Electronics, Clothing, Home, Books, Sports)
- **Product_Name**: Specific product name
- **Region**: Sales region (North, South, East, West, Central)
- **Sales_Amount**: Revenue from the sale
- **Quantity**: Number of items sold
- **Customer_Age**: Age of the customer
- **Customer_Gender**: Gender of the customer (M/F)
- **Discount_Applied**: Whether a discount was applied (Yes/No)

## Key Business Questions to Answer

Your dashboard should address these critical business questions:

1. **Sales Performance**:
   - What are the overall sales trends over time?
   - Which products and categories perform best?
   - How do sales vary by region and store type?

2. **Customer Analysis**:
   - What is the customer demographic profile?
   - How does customer age and gender affect purchasing behavior?
   - What is the impact of discounts on sales volume and revenue?

3. **Seasonal Patterns**:
   - Are there seasonal trends in sales?
   - Which products show the strongest seasonal effects?
   - How should inventory be planned based on seasonal patterns?

4. **Regional Performance**:
   - Which regions are top performers?
   - Are there significant differences in product preferences by region?
   - How do regional sales representatives compare?

5. **Pricing and Discounts**:
   - What is the relationship between discounts and sales volume?
   - Do discounts actually increase profitability?
   - Which products benefit most from promotional pricing?
