## Getting Started

1. **Set up your environment**:
   ```bash
   # Create a virtual environment
   python -m venv web_dev_env
   
   # Activate the virtual environment
   # On Windows:
   web_dev_env\Scripts\activate
   # On macOS/Linux:
   source web_dev_env/bin/activate
   
   # Install required packages
   pip install flask requests sqlalchemy pytest flask-sqlalchemy
   ```

2. **Verify your setup**:
   ```python
   import flask
   import requests
   import sqlalchemy
   print("All packages installed successfully!")
   ```

3. **Start with the first lesson**: HTTP Basics
