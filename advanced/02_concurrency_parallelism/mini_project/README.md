from scraper import ThreadingScraper, AsyncioScraper
import asyncio

# Threading approach
threading_scraper = ThreadingScraper(max_workers=5)
urls = ["https://example.com", "https://httpbin.org/html"]
results = threading_scraper.scrape_urls(urls)

# Asyncio approach
async def main():

## Conclusion

This project brings together all the concurrency concepts learned in this module in a practical, real-world application. You'll gain hands-on experience with threading, multiprocessing, and asyncio while building something useful and educational.

Remember to focus on understanding the trade-offs between different approaches and when to use each one. The goal is not just to build a working scraper, but to understand the principles of concurrent programming that you can apply to other projects.

Good luck, and happy scraping! 🕷️
