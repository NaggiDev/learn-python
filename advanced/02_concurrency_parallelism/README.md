# Concurrency and Parallelism

## Module Overview

This module introduces advanced concepts in concurrent and parallel programming with Python. You'll learn how to write programs that can execute multiple tasks simultaneously, improving performance and responsiveness. The module covers threading, multiprocessing, asynchronous programming, and common concurrency patterns used in real-world applications.

Concurrency and parallelism are essential skills for modern Python developers, especially when building applications that need to handle multiple operations simultaneously, such as web servers, data processing pipelines, or I/O-intensive applications.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have completed:

- **Intermediate Level**: Object-Oriented Programming, Functional Programming, Modules and Packages, Testing and Debugging
- **Advanced Level**: Advanced Data Structures and Algorithms
- **Core Python Skills**: Functions, classes, error handling, file operations
- **Understanding of**: Basic computer science concepts like processes, threads, and system resources

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

### Knowledge Objectives
- Understand the difference between concurrency and parallelism
- Explain the concepts of threads, processes, and asynchronous execution
- Identify when to use threading vs multiprocessing vs asyncio
- Understand common concurrency challenges (race conditions, deadlocks, etc.)
- Know the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) and its implications

### Skill Objectives
- Create and manage threads using Python's threading module
- Implement process-based parallelism using multiprocessing
- Write asynchronous code using asyncio and async/await syntax
- Apply synchronization primitives (locks, semaphores, queues)
- Implement common concurrency patterns (producer-consumer, worker pools)
- Debug and troubleshoot concurrent programs

### Application Objectives
- Build multi-threaded applications for I/O-bound tasks
- Create multi-process applications for CPU-bound tasks
- Develop asynchronous applications for high-concurrency scenarios
- Optimize program performance through parallel execution
- Handle shared resources safely in concurrent environments
