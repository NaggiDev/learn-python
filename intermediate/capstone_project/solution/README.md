- CSV export for data analysis
- Automatic cache cleanup
- Configurable cache duration

### Analysis Algorithms
- Used numpy-style statistical functions
- Implemented moving averages with configurable windows
- Added seasonal decomposition for pattern detection
- Created simple linear regression for forecasting

### Visualization
- ASCII-based charts for terminal compatibility
- Scalable chart dimensions
- Color coding for different data types
- Export to multiple formats
