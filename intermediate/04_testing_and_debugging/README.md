# Testing and Debugging

## Module Overview

This module introduces essential testing and debugging practices in Python development. You'll learn how to write effective tests, debug code systematically, implement logging, and use code quality tools to maintain high standards in your Python projects. These skills are crucial for professional software development and will help you build more reliable and maintainable applications.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have completed:
- Basic Level: Python Fundamentals, Data Structures, and File Operations
- Intermediate Level: Object-Oriented Programming, Functional Programming, and Modules and Packages

You should be comfortable with:
- Writing Python functions and classes
- Understanding Python modules and packages
- Basic error handling with try/except blocks
- Using the command line and virtual environments

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

### Testing Skills
- Understand the importance of testing in software development
- Write unit tests using the pytest framework
- Create test cases that cover different scenarios including edge cases
- Use assertions effectively to validate code behavior
- Organize and structure test files and test suites
- Run tests and interpret test results
- Implement test fixtures and parameterized tests
- Practice test-driven development (TDD) methodology

### Debugging Skills
- Identify and categorize different types of bugs
- Use Python's built-in debugger (pdb) effectively
- Apply systematic debugging strategies and techniques
- Read and interpret error messages and stack traces
- Use print statements and logging for debugging
- Debug code in different environments (IDE, command line)
- Prevent common bugs through defensive programming practices

### Logging Skills
- Understand the purpose and benefits of logging
- Configure Python's logging module for different use cases
- Use appropriate log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL)
- Format log messages effectively
- Direct logs to different outputs (console, files, remote services)
- Implement logging in real-world applications
- Use logging for debugging and monitoring

### Code Quality Skills
- Understand the importance of code quality and maintainability
- Use linters (pylint, flake8) to identify code issues
- Apply code formatters (black, autopep8) for consistent styling
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use type hints and static type checking with mypy
- Measure and improve code coverage
- Integrate code quality tools into development workflow

## Learning Outcomes

After completing this module, you will have:

1. **Professional Testing Skills**: Ability to write comprehensive test suites that ensure code reliability and catch regressions early in development.

2. **Systematic Debugging Approach**: Confidence in identifying, isolating, and fixing bugs using various debugging tools and techniques.

3. **Effective Logging Implementation**: Skills to implement proper logging that aids in debugging, monitoring, and maintaining applications in production.

4. **Code Quality Awareness**: Understanding of how to maintain high code quality standards using automated tools and best practices.

5. **Industry-Ready Practices**: Knowledge of testing and debugging practices commonly used in professional software development environments.

## Module Structure

This module is organized into the following lessons and exercises:

1. **Unit Testing with pytest** - Learn to write and run tests using Python's most popular testing framework
2. **Debugging Techniques** - Master systematic approaches to finding and fixing bugs
3. **Logging** - Implement effective logging for debugging and monitoring
4. **Code Quality Tools** - Use automated tools to maintain code quality and consistency
5. **Mini-Project: Test-Driven Development Exercise** - Apply TDD methodology to build a feature from scratch

## Time Estimate

- **Lessons and Exercises**: 8-12 hours
- **Mini-Project**: 4-6 hours
- **Total**: 12-18 hours
