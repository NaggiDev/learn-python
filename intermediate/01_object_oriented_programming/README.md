# Object-Oriented Programming in Python

## Module Overview

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses objects and classes as the central organizing principle. This module builds upon your basic Python knowledge and introduces you to the powerful world of object-oriented design and implementation in Python.

In this module, you'll learn how to structure your code using classes and objects, implement inheritance hierarchies, apply encapsulation principles, and leverage Python's special methods to create intuitive and powerful class interfaces. By the end of this module, you'll be able to design and implement object-oriented solutions to complex problems.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:

- Completed the Basic Level modules (Python Fundamentals, Data Structures, File Operations)
- Understanding of Python functions and scope
- Familiarity with Python data structures (lists, dictionaries, etc.)
- Basic experience with Python error handling

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

1. **Understand OOP Concepts**
   - Explain the core principles of object-oriented programming
   - Identify when to use OOP versus procedural programming approaches
   - Recognize OOP patterns in existing Python libraries

2. **Create and Use Classes**
   - Define classes with appropriate attributes and methods
   - Instantiate objects and access their properties and methods
   - Implement constructors and destructors
   - Apply proper naming conventions for classes, methods, and attributes

3. **Implement Inheritance and Polymorphism**
   - Create class hierarchies using inheritance
   - Override methods in derived classes
   - Implement multiple inheritance and understand method resolution order
   - Apply polymorphic behavior through method overriding

4. **Apply Encapsulation and Abstraction**
   - Use Python's conventions for private and protected attributes
   - Implement property decorators for controlled attribute access
   - Create abstract base classes and interfaces
   - Design classes that hide implementation details

5. **Utilize Magic Methods**
   - Implement special methods to customize object behavior
   - Create classes that work with Python's built-in functions
   - Develop classes that support operators and behave like built-in types
   - Implement context managers using `__enter__` and `__exit__`

## Module Structure

This module is organized into the following lessons:

1. **Classes and Objects**
   - Class definition and instantiation
   - Attributes and methods
   - Constructors and `self`
   - Instance vs. class attributes and methods

2. **Inheritance and Polymorphism**
   - Creating class hierarchies
   - Method overriding
   - Multiple inheritance and MRO
   - Abstract classes and interfaces

3. **Encapsulation and Abstraction**
   - Private and protected attributes
   - Property decorators
   - Abstract base classes
   - Design principles for encapsulation

4. **Magic Methods**
   - Object representation (`__str__`, `__repr__`)
   - Operator overloading
   - Container methods
   - Context managers

5. **Mini-Project: Library Management System**
   - Apply OOP concepts to design and implement a library management system
   - Practice inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and magic methods

## Learning Outcomes

After completing this module, you will be able to:

1. Design and implement Python programs using object-oriented principles
2. Create class hierarchies that model real-world relationships
3. Write code that properly encapsulates implementation details
4. Leverage Python's special methods to create intuitive class interfaces
5. Apply OOP design patterns to solve complex programming problems
6. Analyze existing code to identify opportunities for OOP refactoring

## Progression Path

This module is part of the Intermediate Level in the Python Learning Path. After completing this module, you should proceed to:

1. **Functional Programming** - Learn about another programming paradigm that complements OOP
2. **Modules and Packages** - Understand how to organize your OOP code into reusable packages
3. **Testing and Debugging** - Learn techniques for testing and debugging object-oriented code
