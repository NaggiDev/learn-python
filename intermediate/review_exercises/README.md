# Intermediate to Advanced Review Exercises

## Overview

These review exercises are designed to reinforce intermediate Python concepts while introducing advanced-level thinking and techniques. Each exercise combines multiple intermediate concepts and provides a bridge to advanced topics like concurrency, web development, and data analysis.

## Learning Objectives

By completing these exercises, you will:
- Reinforce object-oriented programming principles through complex applications
- Practice functional programming patterns in real-world scenarios
- Integrate testing and debugging practices into larger projects
- Prepare for advanced topics like concurrency, web APIs, and data processing
- Develop architectural thinking and design pattern awareness

## Prerequisites

Before starting these exercises, you should have completed:
- Intermediate Level: Object-Oriented Programming
- Intermediate Level: Functional Programming
- Intermediate Level: Modules and Packages
- Intermediate Level: Testing and Debugging

## Exercise Structure

Each exercise includes:
- Complex problem statement requiring multiple intermediate concepts
- Starter code with architectural guidance
- Comprehensive test suites
- Reference solution with advanced patterns
- Extension challenges that introduce advanced concepts

## Exercises

1. **Concurrent Data Processor** - Combines OOP, functional programming, and introduces threading
2. **RESTful API Client Library** - Integrates modules, testing, and introduces web concepts
3. **Plugin-Based Text Analyzer** - Uses advanced OOP patterns and introduces architecture concepts
4. **Async Task Queue System** - Bridges functional programming to async/await patterns
5. **Data Pipeline with Monitoring** - Combines all intermediate concepts with logging and metrics

All exercises are now implemented and ready for completion!

## Getting Started

1. Choose an exercise that interests you or start with the first one
2. Read through the requirements and architectural notes carefully
3. Implement your solution using the provided starter code structure
4. Run the comprehensive test suite to validate your implementation
5. Compare your solution with the reference implementation
6. Try the extension challenges to explore advanced concepts

## Advanced Concepts Introduced

These exercises serve as a gentle introduction to:
- **Concurrency and Parallelism**: Threading basics and synchronization
- **Web Development**: HTTP clients, API design patterns
- **Software Architecture**: Plugin systems, dependency injection
- **Asynchronous Programming**: Event loops and async patterns
- **Data Engineering**: Pipeline patterns and monitoring

## Tips for Success

- Focus on clean, maintainable code architecture
- Use appropriate design patterns for each problem
- Write comprehensive tests before implementing features
- Consider performance and scalability in your solutions
- Document your design decisions and trade-offs
