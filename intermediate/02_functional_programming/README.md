# Functional Programming in Python

## Module Overview

This module introduces functional programming concepts in Python, teaching you how to write more expressive, concise, and maintainable code using functional programming paradigms. You'll learn about lambda functions, higher-order functions, decorators, and generators - powerful tools that will enhance your Python programming skills.

Functional programming emphasizes the use of functions as first-class objects, immutability, and the composition of functions to solve complex problems. While Python is not a purely functional language, it provides excellent support for functional programming concepts that can make your code more elegant and efficient.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have completed:
- Basic Level: Python Fundamentals, Data Structures, and File Operations
- Intermediate Level: Object-Oriented Programming

You should be comfortable with:
- Python functions and scope
- Basic data structures (lists, dictionaries, tuples)
- Object-oriented programming concepts
- Exception handling

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

### Core Functional Programming Concepts
- Understand the principles of functional programming and how they apply to Python
- Distinguish between imperative and functional programming approaches
- Apply functional programming concepts to solve real-world problems

### Lambda Functions
- Create and use anonymous functions (lambda expressions)
- Understand when to use lambda functions vs. regular functions
- Apply lambda functions in various contexts and scenarios

### Higher-Order Functions
- Master the use of `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()` functions
- Transform and process data using functional operations
- Chain functional operations for complex data transformations
- Understand the benefits of functional data processing

### Decorators
- Understand the decorator pattern and its applications
- Create custom decorators for various purposes
- Use built-in decorators and third-party decorator libraries
- Apply decorators for logging, timing, authentication, and other cross-cutting concerns

### Generators and Iterators
- Understand the iteration protocol in Python
- Create custom iterators and generators
- Use generator expressions for memory-efficient data processing
- Apply generators for handling large datasets and streaming data

### Practical Applications
- Build data processing pipelines using functional programming techniques
- Optimize code performance using functional approaches
- Write more readable and maintainable code using functional patterns
