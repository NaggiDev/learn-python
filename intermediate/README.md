# Intermediate Level Python Learning

## Overview

The Intermediate Level is designed for learners who have completed the Basic Level or have equivalent Python knowledge. This level focuses on more advanced programming concepts, software design principles, and best practices for writing maintainable code.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this level, you will be able to:

- Apply object-oriented programming principles in Python
- Utilize functional programming techniques
- Create and organize code using modules and packages
- Implement proper testing and debugging strategies
- Manage dependencies and virtual environments
- Build more complex applications with proper architecture
- Apply best practices for code organization and documentation
