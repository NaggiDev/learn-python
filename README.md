# Python Learning Path

A comprehensive Python learning path designed to help users master Python through a practical "experience -> repeat -> learning" approach.

## Overview

This learning path is structured into multiple levels (basic, intermediate, advanced) with each level building upon the previous one. The focus is on providing hands-on experience through real-world projects, reinforcing concepts through repetition, and facilitating deep learning through practical application.

## Learning Path Structure

### Basic Level
- Python Fundamentals
- Data Structures
- File Operations
- Capstone Project: Command-line Task Manager

### Intermediate Level
- Object-Oriented Programming
- Functional Programming
- Modules and Packages
- Testing and Debugging
- Capstone Project: Weather Data Analysis Application

### Advanced Level
- Advanced Data Structures and Algorithms
- Concurrency and Parallelism
- Web Development
- Data Science Fundamentals
- Capstone Project: Full-stack Web Application with Data Analysis

## Getting Started

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system. If not, follow the installation guide in `resources/setup_guides`.
2. Start with the Basic Level by navigating to the `basic/01_python_fundamentals` directory.
3. Follow the instructions in each module's README.md file.
4. Complete the exercises and mini-projects in each module.
5. After completing all modules in a level, tackle the level's capstone project.
6. Move on to the next level once you've mastered the current one.

## Learning Methodology

This learning path follows the "experience -> repeat -> learning" methodology:

1. **Experience**: Each concept is introduced with practical exercises and real-world examples.
2. **Repeat**: Key concepts appear multiple times in different contexts to reinforce learning.
3. **Learning**: Deep understanding is achieved through application in progressively complex projects.

## Resources

- Setup guides for different operating systems
- Python cheat sheets for quick reference
- Recommended readings and additional resources

## Prerequisites

- No prior programming experience is required for the Basic Level.
- Intermediate Level requires completion of Basic Level or equivalent knowledge.
- Advanced Level requires completion of Intermediate Level or equivalent knowledge.
